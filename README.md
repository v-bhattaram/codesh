When to Use AWS:
Tightly Integrated AWS Ecosystem
Ideal if you're already using AWS services like S3, IAM, Glue, Lambda, and Redshift — you get deep integration and unified security management.

Cost and Flexibility at Scale
Services like EMR let you control instance types and scaling, giving you cost-efficiency for large Spark workloads and long-running batch jobs.

ML: Use SageMaker for Managed ML Pipelines
AWS SageMaker works well with data in S3 and PySpark outputs; it supports training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment at scale in a managed way.

When to Use Snowflake:
Focus on SQL Analytics and Simplicity
Great for teams focused on data analysis rather than infrastructure — write SQL and push ML-ready data to external engines easily.

Separation of Compute and Storage
Isolate ML feature engineering workloads from analytics workloads without interfering with performance.

ML: Partner ML Integration (e.g., DataRobot, H2O, or Snowpark ML)
While Snowflake doesn’t run full training jobs, it can prepare and serve features via Snowpark (with PySpark) or integrate with external ML platforms or models.

When to Use Databricks:
Advanced Spark + ML Workloads
Built specifically for heavy PySpark and ML workloads — supports streaming, complex transformations, and GPU-based training.

Collaborative Development at Scale
Unified notebooks for engineers, analysts, and data scientists to build, tune, and track ML models collaboratively.

ML: Native MLflow & Delta Lake for ML Lifecycle
First-class support for model versioning, experiment tracking (via MLflow), and production-grade pipelines using Delta Lake and PySpark.
